## Key Technical Decisions

1. **PDF Processing**:
   - Chose `pdfplumber` over `PDFLoader` for better text extraction
   - Added comprehensive text cleaning

2. **Tool Design**:
   - BaseTool implementation for CrewAI compatibility
   - Separate metric extraction logic
   - Query-response integration

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Try-catch blocks in all tools
   - API exception handling
   - File operation safety

4. **LLM Integration**:
   - Centralized LLM configuration
   - Temperature control for medical accuracy
   - Retry mechanism

The system now provides reliable, professional blood test analysis with proper safety measures and documentation.
